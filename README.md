# Dingo Quadurped FreeCAD
This project is rebuilding the Dingo Quadruped robot from the step files available on GrabCAD into an a FreeCAD model that utilizes the Assembly 4 workbench for assembly. This project also contains the modifications of the parts based on the following changes.

-  Base plates top and bottom split into two pieces with overlapping tabs. This allows for 3D printing these as opposed to cutting them from acrylic.
-  Base plate bottom modified to have stand offs for mounting the front DC to DC buck converter and the Raspberry Pi.
-  Modified servo carriers to facilitate easier assembly and disassembly by encapsulating nuts into the carriages.

In addition to the modified parts, the goal is to also put together assembly instructions utilizing the TechDraw workbench in FreeCAD.
